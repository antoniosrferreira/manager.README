# Bruno’s manager README

## Disclaimer

This document **MUST** not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division, team or manager of ${company_X}. You might find that my beliefs and style might not be wholly aligned and sometimes even incompatible with what you see throughout the business and that’s OK! This is a document on me, and it applies to me only.

## Welcome

I’m pleased to welcome you. You will work at ${company_X}, where I hope it becomes a place where you’ll grow, have fun and contribute. I’m also hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm, the journey gets easier for all of us.

I look forward to working with you.

**Welcome to the team!**

## Motivations behind this document

Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager’s README, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste, and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress, and it’s meant to be documentation on me.

Few reasons for this document to exist:

* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, expectations and self-awareness
* You should know as much as possible how interfacing with me looks like. Does “loosely in coupling and high in cohesion” rings a bell?
* To share my expectations for what I believe is the most effective way for us to work
* For you to help me improve and **holding me accountable**
* Reduce managerial overhead on both sides. You don’t need to put too much effort on “managing up”, and I don’t have to “manage down”, win-win.
* Hopefully, this will help us work better together

**Important**: this document is *NOT* meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We’ll learn more about each other organically.

Btw, have you noticed the repo license is MIT? What can this possibly mean?

## Hi, I’m Bruno

I was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1983, where I lived for 24 years before moving to Lisbon and 5 years later to London. I’m a father to a baby boy and partner to a wonderful woman that balances my life. As you will find, I’m a bit of a workaholic. I like to travel; to meet new people – people are the colour of life; good food; watch TV series & films; read technical, business, economics and management books/news/articles/posts; cars (fast cars!); tennis; coding (yes I still code!); long walks and spending time with my family. My partner says that I spend all my time moving from a screen to another – from my laptop to my work phone, to my personal phone, to my TV, to my kindle…

I’m a by-product of several variables: genetics, family & social relationships, the context/environment that I’m currently at and scar tissue (AKA experience). Some of the traits that have been flagged to me over the years are forthright, upright, committed, hard-working, driven, obsessed by learning & winning and loyal.

Some of my quirks while working:

* I’m all-in, always-on, all the time. I don’t expect you to follow my example and I recommend that you don’t. That’s just how I work best.
* I have very little patience for apathy and indifference, if something is going on, let me know ASAP.
* I have very little patience for BS, toxic culture, “box tickers” and “talk and no walk”.
* My communication skills degrade as I get tired.
* I tend to talk a bit too much. I know it is annoying, please call it out. I’m trying to improve by optimising for effectiveness, and within it, I’ll try to be as kind as possible.
* You most likely will get emails or slack messages over the weekends or late at night or on holidays. Don’t feel compelled to reply, I’m not expecting it from you! It’s just me being ON all the time.
* I’m biased towards transparency and radical candour. You can ask me anything. Most of the time, you’ll get an answer. Sometimes I can’t, but I’m committed to never lie to you.
* I’m heavily biased towards action. There’s value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and fast iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast / learn-fast) and make visible progress.

## My job

As a Software Engineering Manager, my job is to:

* Foster and nurture a strong and healthy Software Engineering culture founded on great people, operational excellence and customer-centricity
* Help ${company_X} processes & technology so that we can have a scalable organisation by:
  * Attract and retain world-class talent (that’s you).
  * Coach & Mentor teams and individuals.
  * Reduce managerial overhead, establish processes and streamline existing processes.
* We have a “default to yes” mindset while providing clear tradeoff to relevant stakeholders. We can do anything Product wants!
* Get everybody to focus on the Customer.
* Make tie-breaking decisions.
* Put in place checks & balances.
* Help to develop ${company_X} Engineering brand.
* Set context so that you can connect the dots on what ${company_X} needs, understand what’s your priority & focus and what you need to be successful.
* Help you to build effective relationships with others in the company so you can be as self-sufficient as possible.
* Provide technical advice when required.

## How do I manage

### General principles

* You work for ${company_X} not for me, always optimise for the company.
* You’re my top priority, so should be every one that reports to you.
* I serve you, not the other way around.
* Customers at the forefront and centre of everything that we do.
* I make as few decisions as possible. Still, not a democracy.
* Teams are autonomous, self-organised and ultimately self-directed.
* We work as one team, delivering on time and with high quality.
* ICs and teams impact, development and growth is notable, quarter over quarter.
* We move fast, very fast.
* If I do something that’s impacting my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP
* If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting the context, you’d be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP.
* I’m making mistakes, please let me know and hold me accountable!

### How do I measure success of our team

* Customer's quantitative and qualitative feedback about features we ship is positive e.g. NPS, active usage, etc.
* We're strong contributors to the {company_X} objectives and key results.
* Teams health is high.
* Everyone well-being is high.

### Decision-making

I expect you to make decisions all the time as autonomous as possible and be right often. I also expect you to ask for help or advice when you’re not sure or you could use a second opinion. You’re are not alone, I’m here for you.

#### Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI)

**Note:** Follow [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/02/how-well-does-apples-directly-responsible-individual-dri-model-work-in-practice/#39e50b0a194c) for more context

Being DRI means:

* That a decision is either yours, or mine, but not both.
* You don’t have to get consensus, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t actively seek for it. You should have a good reason for not getting it and be able to articulate it when requested.
* You don’t have to reach an agreement, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t actively seek for it. You should have a good reason for not getting it and be able to articulate it when requested.
* The scope of my responsibility does not enclose your scope of responsibility
* I cannot override you, but I can try to persuade you
* If you make a mistake, you fix it, don’t wait for someone to tell you

Being DRI does not mean:

* You get to be thoughtless
* You’re exempt from having to explain why you made a particular decision
* You’re exempt from people telling you, ahead of time or afterwards, that you made a mistake.
* Your choices won’t be challenged by other stakeholders

#### Decision-making reasoning

Reasoning is using data, facts and process to decide about possible courses of action. We strive to move fast, but the world surrounding us is complex, ambiguous and uncertain. More often than not, we can’t wait to have all the information available to make a decision. Still, we need to make it. The formula that I use embraces that we make decisions in imperfect conditions: we need 70% of the information to make a decision, but we need to be great at correcting course and learning (can’t remember from where I’ve learned this from).

I tend to optimise for:

* What’s the best for the Customer today, mid and long term? How does good looks like so I have a reference point in order to evaluate other options.
* What’s the cost of delay of making the decision?
* Can it be reversed? Will it open other options in the future? How? When?
* Are we going to learn something new?

Decisions logs are great, give it a go.

#### Decision-making intuition

Intuition is using your ‘gut feeling’ about possible courses of action. Although some people perceive it as something magical ‘sense’ only available to some, IMHO intuition is a combination of past experience and your personal values. It is worth taking intuition into account because it reflects your learnings. It is, however, not always based on reality, only your perceptions. I’ve found writing down my thoughts and seeking data to back it up helps me being right more often. Sometimes is not about the end result but the process.

It’s perfectly acceptable to use your intuition to make a decision that’s simple in nature or needs to be made quickly.

#### ‘deciding not to decide’ is also a decision

Deciding not to decide is perhaps one of the toughest decisions one can make. After all, we’re expected to make decisions and to act! Not making a decision might feel unnatural or even wrong. It’s a valid decision as any other, and it should always be on the table. It should follow the same decision-making process as any other decision.

#### Decision-making process

* Write it down with 6 pages or less. Less is more!
* State the problem, assumptions, constraints and risks.
* Simplify, simplify simplify! Challenge everything! Model the problem!
* Define how good looks like.
* What are the options available to us today.
* Define risk mitigations.
* Focus on the data and outcomes.
* Keep yourself in check. Don’t let your ego/emotions get in the way.

Make a decision!

#### Roadblocks and escalation

When you bump into a roadblock that you can’t solve or something needs approval from high, let me know. I’ll work with you. Don’t get hung up on “process”, upcoming meetings and such. Just-in-time escalation is usually more efficient.

#### When the decision it’s not yours to make, or you weren’t included

If you agree with the decision, happy days. Joins forces and get it done. It is, however, harder to buy-in into a decision that you don’t agree with or you weren’t included. While I’ll always try to include you, life happens, the world is not perfect. You’re expected to:

* Express clearly why you don’t agree with the decision on the right forum.
* Provide clear, factual based and valid alternatives.
* Be a team player.
* If the decision hasn’t changed, Disagree and Commit. Stand by it to the end while giving your best to make it a success.

### Communication

#### Share information openly, broadly and deliberately

Nothing to hide, all to share. Feel free to talk with anybody in the business. From C-levels to everyone else. If there’s something wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together. Also, deliberately create/use communication forums to share information. Default to share everything, but use the right forums, so that is not considered “noise”. When it gets to be too much sharing, someone will tell you, and you adjust if needed.

#### Radical candour

Follow the links, take your time to digest it:

* <https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/why-radical-candour-may-key-successful-leader/1430852>
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh-pG27cHtw>
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj9GLeNCgm4>

#### Feedback

* Feedback is critical to our success and I love it
* Radical Candour at its heart but don’t forget the below bullet point
* [Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):
  * Safety - unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback: should be high
  * Effort - The amount of work to provide feedback, also known as “how much do you argue when people give you feedback?”: should be low
  * Benefit - how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behaviour?: should be high
* Let me know if I don’t do well
* I’ll let you know if you don’t
* Performance reviews should never be a surprise for you, if it is, let me know

#### One-on-ones

That’s your time, to talk about you and to address any concern. Let’s get to know each other better. If you want to spend this time talking about projects progress or anything else related to it, it’s your choice. Still, I advise otherwise as you can always book a meeting with me to address those.

Our 1:1s are weekly and for 1h. Should you wish to change the frequency or length, please let me know. If you don’t spend all of the 30min, I give myself the right to take the remaining time to provide you with more context.

By default every month we’ll hold a one-on-one retrospective. This way, we can continuously improve the one-on-ones. We’ll have a private online document between us where we collate notes from the one-on-ones that will help us on the retrospectives.

Tips:

* Start from where you left off
* Prepare your topics in advance
* Have recommended actions for your concerns (it’s a journey for both, don’t expect me to have everything figured out)

#### Reporting

Create a regular, systematic, clearly framed written process by which you share your progress against plan progress, RAG, risks/mitigations, assumptions and issues/blockers. Share this update with me no less frequently than weekly. I place a high premium on data and well thought mitigation actions. Should something is RED for more than a couple of weeks, it becomes the focus on my attention and you should be all over it to find *the path to GREEN.*

Perhaps {company_X} has a delivery department or something alike, I expect you work closely with them and be accountable for what's being reported. In this case, your report to me doesn't need to include Delivery related information and should focus on what's going on the ground (e.g. acquisition and retention of talent, people issues, facilities issues, etc.) and how are you progressing with your OKRs/Goals.

#### What to do when you get a message from me

I don’t expect you to respond to everything in real-time, but do expect you to close the loop on everything we open in a timely manner. If it’s on my plate, I will do the same, but try to take things that are in your function off my plate and into your management/organisation/prioritisation system. I get frustrated when I have to ask about something twice or if I'm asked about something that we've agreed you should have come back to me.

I like fast turnaround and acknowledgement on written communications like “got it” or “on it” type acknowledgment so I know things that we’re discussing are moving.

I tend to send quite a few of FYI so that you're in the loop. There's no need to reply unless you have a simple question that's can't be discussed on other forums.

If you're CC'ed, I'm not expecting you to reply, but it's perfectly acceptable that you choose to do so. Just be conscious that you're jumping on someone else conversation.

#### Get a hold on me

I’m usually quite busy and it's hard to find me at my desk. I will always make myself available if you need me. Some tips that can help you get a hold on me:

* Emergency: find me at my desk or around the office -> call me -> text me -> slack me -> drop me an email. Do whatever you need to do to get a hold on me.
* Urgent matter: text me -> slack me -> drop me an email.
* Important matter: slack me -> drop me an email.
* BAU: drop me an email -> book a meeting

If you suggest a meeting or discussion, initiate finding time on my diary and make an appointment on my calendar. If I suggest a discussion, I will initiate finding time. Don't say “let's discuss” without a quick follow-up of when we’ll discuss.

### Leadership

**Everyone is a leader and leadership comes from everywhere.** Leadership is not just for managers. You’ll find throughout your career that management is orthogonal to leadership. I expect different team members will need to step into leadership roles, contribute, and step back once the need for their specific skills has passed.

**A Leadership Primer** from General Colin Powell, Chairman (Ret), Joint Chiefs of Staff. 18 valuable lessons that you should be aware of (<http://govleaders.org/powell.htm).> Some are really close to my heart:

* “Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off.”
* “The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.”
* “Organization doesn’t really accomplish anything. Plans don’t accomplish anything, either. Theories of management don’t much matter. Endeavours succeed or fail because of the people involved. **Only by attracting the best people will you accomplish great deeds.**”
* “Organization charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing.”
* “Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.”
* “The commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong unless proved otherwise.” (lead from the trenches)

**Command & control or authoritative leadership style (AKA top-down)** is not advisable! Only when a team is in *survival mode* and for a short period, I’ll not question if your judgement is sound. I also appreciate a heads-up when you feel is needed.

**Servant leadership** is highly advisable, you should always strive for it. Still, it requires yourself and the team a great deal of maturity, or stuff doesn’t get done and “too many cooks in the kitchen” syndrome creeps in. Sometimes one who wants to be a servant leader can easily fall into an absent leader. Be thoughtful about how to take your team on the journey. Does this mean the team just does whatever they want, and the manager has no say? No. You and your teamwork to define and prioritise impactful work with the rest of the stakeholders, including product managers, designers, and others and in line with business priorities.

### Technology

TODO

### Innovation

Innovation comes from everyone, everywhere and at any time. When possible and on the remit of your team, apply “small, fast and measurable” iterations and get on with it. Share the findings when you’re ready.

When innovation requires extensive work that impacts the product roadmap and/or other teams, it has to be discussed across Tech and/or Product. To have a productive discussion, you and your team should put it down in writing so that we can have an asynchronous conversation. I very fun of A3 thinking that’s usually used to find root causes issues. I find the template quite useful for any meaningful change. Still, I’m open to any format that you find helpful to express the idea.

[A3 template](https://www.crisp.se/gratis-material-och-guider/a3-template)

The document should provide a high-level view of the innovation and then go down into the details.

TIP: Be pedantic and technically sound.

## What I believe

Below you’ll find my core beliefs.

**I believe** that teams are more important than superstars. Although it is always good to have around superstars so that we can learn from them.

**I believe** in Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI).

**I believe** teams are gown not hired.

**I believe** experimentation as a constant practice for learning. Experiment with people, tools, processes and environment.

**I believe** managers are a necessary evil, that exists to scale the organisation.

**I believe** (strongly!) on Conway’s law: “any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose is a copy of the organisation communication structure”. ${company_X} future partially depends on how well and often we communicate, let’s optimise for it.

**I believe** QA, Security, Ops, Culture and Product success is everyone responsibility!

**I believe** in short feedback loops, fail-fast and reduced blast radius. It’s OK to fail as long as we learn the lesson and share our learnings. Tolerance ZERO for blame!

**I believe** data tells us a great deal. Be data-driven but don’t lose your gut feeling, you’ll need it at the end.

**I believe** in the compounding of continually improving small things through sort and quick iterations.

**I believe** that delivery velocity is largely determined by how well everyone understands where we are, where everyone is and where we’re going (context). Chances are people will self-organise to move in the right direction and take ownership of their delivery. As a result, they will figure out ways to move faster.

**I believe** in Agile, Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery core principles. They are tools, don’t make a great deal of the tools, make a great deal of what you build!

**I believe** that there’s no such thing as personality conflicts at work. We may have disagreements, and that’s OK, it’s not personal. I’ll always try to adjust to personalities styles and you should too.

**I believe** that processes do add value when kept to a minimum and enable teams to work at its best. I need specific procedures in place to be able to manage up and out to the rest of the business. If you ever have feedback on the process(es), please let me know. Btw, processes need to be monitored like any other system. If one can’t describe a process in less than 1min, no one will follow it.

## What I look in managers when hiring

I’ll be looking for:

* Passion for technology and people.
* Is a good coach and mentor.
* Empowers the team and does not micromanage.
* Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being.
* Is productive and results-oriented.
* Is a good communicator — listens and shares information.
* Supports career development and discusses performance.
* Has a clear vision/strategy for the team.
* Has key technical skills to help advise the team.
* Can collaborate effectively across ${company_X}.
* Is a reliable decision-maker.
* Is a fast-learner and continuously seeks to improve one’s skill.
* Foster engineering excellence through fostering pragmatic craftsmanship.
* Our beliefs are aligned and this README reasons with you.

Follow the link to know more about some of the points above <https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/the-evolution-of-project-oxygen/>

## The team

Let me try to describe my ideal for our team:

* Take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny
* Have each other’s back
* Hold each other accountable
* Expect excellence in ourselves and each other
* Assume positive intent
* Always question, always ask “why?”
* Constantly learn
* Laugh together
* Get stuff done!

Please be comfortable with [“Guide: Understand team effectiveness”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgiz6mwZeyWEaJxN_NMI-tI5Qijv2BHh27DPLeSLE40/edit)
