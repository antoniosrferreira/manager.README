# Bruno's manager READMEs

# Disclaimer
This document **MUST** not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division, team or manager of ${company_X}. You might find that my beliefs and style might not be wholly aligned and sometimes even incompatible with what you see throughout the business and that’s OK! This is a document on me, and it applies to me only.

# Welcome
I’m very happy to welcome you. You will work at ${company_X}, where I hope it becomes a place where you’ll grow, have fun and contribute. I’m also hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm, the journey gets easier for all of us.

I look forward to working with you. 

**Welcome to the team!**

# Motivations behind this document
Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager’s README, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste, and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress and it’s meant to be documentation on me.

Few reasons for this document to exist:
* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, expectations and self-awareness
* You should know as much as possible how interfacing with me looks like. Does “loosely in coupling and high in cohesion” rings a bell?
* To share my expectations for what I believe is the most effective way for us to work
* For you to help me improve and **holding me accountable**
* Reduce managerial overhead on both sides. You don’t need to put too much effort on “managing up”, and I don’t have to “manage down”, win-win. 
* Hopefully, this will help us work better together

**Important**: this document is *NOT* meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We’ll learn more about each other organically.

Btw, have you noticed the repo license is MIT? What can this possibly mean?

# Hi, I'm Bruno
I was born in Porto, Portugal in 1983, where I lived for 24 years before moving to Lisbon and 5 years later to London. I’m a father to a baby boy and partner to a wonderful woman that balances my life. As you will find, I’m a bit of a workaholic. I like to travel, to meet new people – people are the colour of life –, good food, watch TV series & films, read technical, business, economics and management books/news/articles/posts, cars (fast cars!), tennis, coding (yes I still code!), long walks and spending time with my family. My partner says that I spend all the time moving from a screen to another – from my laptop to my work phone, to my personal phone, to my TV, to my kindle… You’ll find me listening to Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Moby quite often, it won’t affect my mood!

I’m a by-product of several variables: genetics, family & social relationships, the context/environment that I’m currently at and scar tissue (AKA experience). Some of the traits that have been flagged to me over the years are forthright, upright, committed, hard-working, driven, obsessed by learning & winning and loyal.

Some of my quirks while working:
* I’m all-in, always-on, all the time. I don’t expect you to follow my example and I recommend that you don’t. That’s just how I work best.
* I have very little patience for apathy and indifference, if something is going on, let me know ASAP.
* I have very little patience for B.S., corporate culture, “box tickers” and “talk and no walk”.
* My communication skills degrade fast as I get tired.
* I talk a lot. If you get lost, call it out. I also tend to repeat myself because I feel I wasn’t clear enough. I know it is annoying. I’m trying to improve by optimising for effectiveness, and within it, I’ll try to be as kind as possible.
* You most likely will get emails or slack messages over the weekends or late at night or on holidays. Don’t feel compelled to reply, I’m not expecting it from you! It’s just me being ON all the time.
* I'm biased toward transparency and radical candour. You can ask anything. Most of the time, you’ll get an answer. Sometimes I can’t, but I'm committed to never lie to you.
* I'm heavily biased towards action. There’s value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and fast iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast / learn-fast) and make visible progress. 

If you’re curious about my professional experience, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunotavares/) where you’ll find that I’ve used a lot of different hats (sometimes simultaneous), across several LOBs and vastly different companies sizes. Tech & people at the spotlight.

# My job
As Software Engineering manager my job is to:
* Help ${company_X} processes & technology so that we can have a scalable organisation by:
  * Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)
  * Coach teams and enable them to grow
  * Mentor ICs & managers
  * Reduce managerial overhead and streamline processes
* We have a “default to yes” mindset while providing clear tradeoffs to relevant stakeholders. We can do anything Product wants!
* Get everybody to focus on Product delivery through strong Software Engineering culture and best practices
* Make tie-breaking decisions
* Put in place checks & balances
* Help to develop ${company_X} Engineering brand
* Set context so that you can connect the dots on what ${company_X} needs, understand what’s your priority & focus and what you need to be successful
* Help you to build effective relationships with others in the company so you can be as self-sufficient as possible
* Provide technical advice when required

# How do I manage

* You work for ${company_X} not for me, always optimise for the company
* You’re my top priority, so should be every one that reports to you
* I serve you, not the other way around
* If I do something that’s impacting my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP
* If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting the context, you'd be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP.
* I’m making mistakes, please let me know and hold me accountable!
* I’m a strong advocate of Freedom & Responsibility

## My overall goals for the team
* Our users at the forefront of everything that we do
* I make the fewer decisions as possible
* Teams are autonomous, self-organised and ultimately self-directed
* Teams efficiency and effectiveness is high
* The product team is happy. We work as one team, delivering on time and with high quality
* ICs and teams impact, development and growth is notable, quarter upon quarter
* Everyone well-being
* Teams health is high, and the attrition rate is low
* We move fast, very fast

## Decision making

I know you can’t decide everything by yourself. You’re are not alone, I’m here for you. 

### Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI)
**Note:** Follow [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/02/how-well-does-apples-directly-responsible-individual-dri-model-work-in-practice/#39e50b0a194c) for more context 

Being DRI means:
* That a decision is either yours, or mine, but not both.
* You don't have to get consensus, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t actively seek for it. You should have a good reason for not getting it and be able to articulate it when requested.
* You don't have to reach an agreement, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t actively seek for it. You should have a good reason for not getting it and be able to articulate it when requested.
* The scope of my responsibility does not enclose your scope of responsibility
* I cannot override you, but I can try to persuade you
* If you make a mistake, you fix it, don't wait for someone to tell you

Being DRI does not mean:
* You get to be thoughtless
* You're exempt from having to explain why you made a certain decision
* You're exempt from people telling you, ahead of time or afterwards, that you made a mistake.
* Your decisions won’t be challenged by other stakeholders

### Escalation
When you bump into a roadblock that you can’t solve or something needs approval from high, let me know. I’ll work with you to try to get it sorted. Don’t get hung up on “process”, upcoming meetings and such. Just-in-time escalation is usually more efficient and effective. Always go back to common sense, your and business priorities.

## Communication

### Share information openly, broadly and deliberately
Nothing to hide, all to share. Feel free to talk with anybody in the business. From C-levels to everyone else. If there’s something wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together. Also, deliberately create communication forums to share information. Default to share everything, but use the right forums, so that is not considered “noise”. When it gets to be too much sharing, someone will tell you, and you adjust if needed.

### Radical candour
Follow the links, take your time to digest it:
* https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/why-radical-candour-may-key-successful-leader/1430852
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh-pG27cHtw
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj9GLeNCgm4 

### Feedback
* Feedback is critical to our success and I love it
* Radical candour at its heart but don’t forget the below bullet point
* [Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):
  * Safety - unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback: should be high
  * Effort - The amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?": should be low
  * Benefit - how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behaviour?: should be high
* Let me know if I don't do well
* I'll let you know if you don't
* Performance reviews should never be a surprise for you, if it is, let me know

### One-on-ones
That’s your time, to talk about you and to address any concern. Let’s get to know each other better. If you want to spend this time talking about projects progress or anything else related to it, it’s your choice, but I advise otherwise as you can always book a meeting with me to address those.

Our 1:1s are weekly and for 30min. Should you wish to change the frequency or length, please let me know. If you don’t spend all of the 30min, I give myself the right to take the remaining time to provide you with more context.

By default every month we’ll hold a one-on-one retrospective. This way we can continuously improve the one-on-ones. We’ll have a private online document between us where we collate notes from the one-on-ones that will help us on the retrospectives.

Tips:
* Start from where you left off
* Prepare your topics in advance
* Have recommended actions for your concerns (it's a journey for both, don’t expect me to have everything figured out)


### All Hands
Every 2-3 weeks everyone that reports to me directly or indirectly will be invited to an All Hands. The All Hands are for Ask me Anything (AKA AMAs), Show & Tell, Shout outs, team-wide context, spend some time together and anything else that makes sense to communicate. I expect everyone that reports directly to me to drive it.

### Get a hold on me
I’m usually quite busy, but you’re my priority. That said you might have to chase me down. Some tips that can help you:
* Emergency: find me at my desk or around the office; call me; text me; slack me; drop me an email. Do whatever you need to do to get a hold on me.
* Urgent matter: find me at my desk or around the office; text me; slack me; drop me an email
* Important matter: book a meeting, slack me or drop me an email.
* Other: drop me an email

## Leadership

**Everyone is a leader and leadership comes from everywhere.** Leadership is not just for managers. You’ll find throughout your career that management is orthogonal to leadership. I expect different team members will need to step into leadership roles, contribute, and step back once the need for their specific skills has passed.

**A Leadership Primer** from General Colin Powell, Chairman (Ret), Joint Chiefs of Staff. 18 valuable lessons that you should be aware of (http://govleaders.org/powell.htm). Some are really close to my heart:
* "Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off." (sometimes you need to break the eggs to do an omelette)
* "The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership."
* "Organization doesn't really accomplish anything. Plans don't accomplish anything, either. Theories of management don't much matter. Endeavours succeed or fail because of the people involved. **Only by attracting the best people will you accomplish great deeds.**"
* "Organization charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing."
* "Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier."
* "The commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong unless proved otherwise." (lead from the trenches)

**Command & control or authoritative leadership style (AKA top-down)** is not advisable! Only when a team is in *survival mode* and for a short period of time I’ll not question if your judgement is sound. I also appreciate a heads-up when you feel is needed.

**Servant leadership** is highly advisable, you should always strive for it, but it requires yourself and the team a great deal of maturity or stuff doesn’t get done and “too many cooks in the kitchen” syndrome creeps in. Sometimes one who wants to be a servant leader can easily fall into an absent leader. Be thoughtful about how to take your team on the journey. Does this mean the team just does whatever they want, and the manager has no say? No. You and your teamwork to define and prioritise impactful work with the rest of the stakeholders, including product managers, designers, and others and in line with business priorities.

## Delivery
TODO

## Innovation
Innovation comes from everyone, everywhere and at any time. When possible and on the remit of your team, apply “small, fast and measurable” iterations and get on with it. Share the findings when you’re ready.

When innovation requires extensive work that impacts the product roadmap and/or other teams, it has to be discussed across Tech and/or Product. In order to have a productive discussion, you and your team should put it down in writing so that we can have an asynchronous discussion. I very fun of A3 thinking that’s usually used to find root causes issues. I find the template quite useful for any meaningful change, but I’m open to any format that you find helpful to express the idea.

[A3 template](https://www.crisp.se/gratis-material-och-guider/a3-template)

The document should provide a high-level view of the innovation and then go down into the details.

TIP: Be pedantic and technically sound.

# What I believe
Below you'll find my core beliefs.

**I believe** that teams are more important than superstars. Although, is always good to have around superstars so that we can learn from them.

**I believe** in Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI).

**I believe** teams are gown not hired.

**I believe** experimentation as a constant practice for learning. Experiment with people, tools, processes and environment.

**I believe** managers are a necessary evil, that exists to scale the organisation.

**I believe** (strongly!) on Conway’s law: “any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose is a copy of the organisation communication structure”. ${company_X} future partially depends on how well and often we communicate, let’s optimise for it.

**I believe** QA, Security, Ops, Culture and Product success is everyone responsibility!

**I believe** in short feedback loops, fail-fast and reduced blast radius. It’s OK to fail as long we learn the lesson and share our learnings. Tolerance ZERO for blame!

**I believe** data tells us a great deal. Be data-driven but don’t lose your gut feeling, you’ll need it at the end.

**I believe** in the compounding of continually improving small things through sort and quick iterations.

**I believe** that delivery velocity is largely determined by how well everyone understands where we are, where everyone is and where we’re going (context). Chances are people will self-organise to move in the right direction and take ownership of their delivery. As result, they will figure out ways to move faster.

**I believe** in Agile, Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery core principles. They are tools, don’t make a great deal of the tools, make a great deal of what you build!

**I believe** that there’s no such thing as personality conflicts at work. We may have disagreements and that’s OK, it’s not personal. I’ll always try to adjust to personalities styles and you should too.

**I believe** that processes do add value when kept to a minimum and enable teams to work at its best. I need certain processes in place to be able to manage up and out to the rest of the business. If you ever have feedback on the process(es), please let me know. Btw, processes need to be monitored like any other system. If one can’t describe a process in less than 1min, no one will follow it.

# What I look in managers when hiring

I’ll be looking for:
* Passion for technology and people
* Is a good coach and mentor
* Empowers the team and does not micromanage
* Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being
* Is productive and results-oriented
* Is a good communicator — listens and shares information
* Supports career development and discusses performance
* Has a clear vision/strategy for the team
* Has key technical skills to help advise the team
* Can collaborate effectively across ${company_X}
* Is a strong decision-maker
* Is a fast-learner and constant seeks to improve one's skill
* Foster engineering excellence through fostering pragmatic craftsmanship
* Our beliefs are aligned and this README reasons with you

# The team
Let me try to describe my ideal for our team:
* Take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny
* Have each other’s back
* Hold each other accountable
* Expect excellence in ourselves and each other
* Assume positive intent
* Always question, always ask “why?”
* Constantly learn
* Laugh together
* Get stuff done!

Please be comfortable with “Guide: Understand team effectiveness”
