# Bruno's manager README

## Disclaimer

This document **MUST** not be read in any way that applies to any other manager from other groups, divisions or teams of ${company_X}.

You will find my document close to those you encounter online and sometimes a copy & paste, and that's OK, it just means I couldn't put it in better words.

This document is a living document.

If you find my beliefs and style are not wholly aligned with what you observe in {company_X}, that's OK.

## Welcome

I'm pleased to welcome you. You work at ${company_X}, where I hope it becomes a place where you'll grow, develop, contribute and have fun. I'm also hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm, the journey gets easier for all.

I look forward to working with you.

**Welcome to the team!**

## Motivations behind this document

Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager's README, I've decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. Few reasons for this document to exist:

* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, and hold myself accountable.
* To share some of my expectations of you and me.
* Establish guiding principles to enable you to do your job efficiently, effectively and with confidence.
* For you to help me improve and **hold me accountable.**
* Lay down the foundation for a symbiotic relationship between us.

**Important**: this document is *NOT* meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We'll learn more about each other over time.

## Hi, I'm Bruno

I was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1983, where I lived for 24 years before moving to Lisbon and 5 years later to London. I'm a father to a baby boy and partner to a wonderful woman. Outside work I like to travel; to meet new people; good food; watch TV series & films; read technical, business, economics and leadership books/news/articles/posts; cars (fast cars!); tennis; coding as a hobby; long walks and spending time with my family.

Some of the attributes that have been hailed to me are: forthright, upright, trustworthy, committed, pragmatic, a doer, an agent of change, helpful, strategic, hard-working, and loyal.

Some of my quirks while working:

* I'm all-in, always-on, all the time. I don't expect you to follow my example and I recommend that you don't. That's just how I work best.
* I have very little patience for:
  * Apathy and indifference, if something is going on, let me know ASAP.
  * BS and toxic culture
  * "box tickers" and "talk and no walk".
  * [Union Leaders](#Union-vs-Business-Leader).
* My communication skills fade out as I get tired.
* I tend to talk a bit too much. I know it is annoying, please call it out. I'm trying to improve.
* You most likely will get messages over the weekends or late at night or on holidays. It's just me being ON all the time. [What to do when you get a message from me.](#What-to-do-when-you-get-a-message-from-me)
* I'm heavily biased towards action. There's value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and quick iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast to learn-fast) and make visible progress. Actions speak louder than words.

## My job

As a Software Engineering Manager, my job is to:

* Foster a cohesive Software Engineering team and a healthy culture founded on world-class talent, operational excellence and customer-centricity.
* Attract and retain world-class talent, that's you.
* Assure the growth and development of individuals and teams through coaching.
* Represent our team up and out.
* Help ${company_X} processes and structure so that we have a scalable and effective organisation.
* Influence decisions.
* Set context so that everyone can connect the dots on what ${company_X} needs, understand what the priorities are and what needs to get done.
* Develop guiding principles to simplify and decentralise decision-making, and to enable teams to make sound judgement calls.
* Help people to develop secondary relationships.
* Help to develop ${company_X} Engineering brand.
* Assure we're all delivering business value according to or above the {company_X} goals.

## General guiding principles

* Integrity and authenticity are **never** up for discussion.
* You work for ${company_X} not for me and I serve you, not the other way around.
* We're a team. Our behaviours are conductive of an effective and efficient team cohesion where everyone belongs, positively impacting outcomes.
* We assume the best on everyone, and every one is authentic until proven otherwise. We set and follow lean and humane check & balances to ensure deviations don't go unacknowledged.
* We're biased towards transparency. Anyone can ask us anything and often will get an answer. Sometimes we can't disclose information, but we're committed to never lie.
* We're biassed towards action. We thrive on getting meaningful work done.
* We **first** expect excellence from ourselves and then from others, but we hold each other backs at all times. Along the way, we're making mistakes. We're committed to take accountability and learn from our mistakes.
* We coach individuals and teams relentlessly. We take it as an article of faith that a culture founded on learning and growing returns better outcomes long-term.
* We embrace that management is not leadership. Both are equally important and crucial but not mutually exclusive or dependent. In an oversimplification fashion:
  * Management is about working with objectives; responsible for quality, processes, hire and retain talent; and deliverables. It's a position in the company.
  * Leadership is about working with goals and vision; and inspiring people towards a goal. Leadership comes from everywhere.

## How do I manage

Your behaviours matter to everyone around you. Model the behaviour in the way you expect people to treat and work with you. If you want the people to move from **know-it-all** to **learn-it-all** you first need to embrace it yourself.

### Management guiding principles

* Our #1 priority is our people. We'll always find time to attract, retain, grow, develop and lead our people while continually raising the bar, even when it is uncomfortable. We take it as an article of faith that is the right decision long-term.
* Customers at the front and centre of everything we deliver.
* We grow with people, there is always room for growth and we seek it relentlessly.
* Feedback is our most valuable and effective tool to keep raising the bar on everything and everyone. We deliver and receive feedback kindly, promptly, and with empathy and candour.
* Processes exist to serve us. We continually review its fit for purpose and ways to improve. A customer must never experience a degraded service while we wait for our processes to complete.
* We take accountability of anything that goes wrong in our team, even if we're not involved in the issue.

### How do I measure the success of our team

1. Team health and everyone's well-being is high.
2. Customer's quantitative and qualitative feedback about the software we ship is positive, e.g. NPS, active usage, etc.
3. We're strong contributors to the {company_X} objectives/goals.

### How am I going to review your performance

* You're good coach and mentor and you have a growth mindset.
* You empower the team(s) and does not micromanage.
* You create a diverse and inclusive team environment, showing concern for the success and well-being of everyone.
* You're productive and results-oriented.
* You're a good communicator — listens actively and shares information.
* You support career development and discuss performance.
* You have a clear vision/strategy for the team.
* You have the technical skills to influence the team.
* You can collaborate effectively across ${company_X}.
* You're a reliable decision-maker.
* You're a fast-learner and continuously seek to improve your skills.
* You foster an influential, productive and healthy Engineering Culture.
* You're a team player.
* We work well together.

### My ideal team

* Everyone has a strong sense of belonging.
* Take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny.
* Have each other's back.
* Hold each other accountable.
* Expect excellence in ourselves and each other.
* Assume positive intent.
* Always question, always ask "why?".
* Constantly learn.
* Laugh together.
* Get stuff done!

Please get comfortable with [Guide: Understand team effectiveness](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgiz6mwZeyWEaJxN_NMI-tI5Qijv2BHh27DPLeSLE40/edit)

### Me as a resource

Be clear what you need from me for your success. The role, comp, org change, more feedback, more context, etc.

Be clear when you need the company's resources. Be data-driven about why you need it, gather alignment from the pertinent stakeholders, and show that you're being cost-conscious. I like justifications that include, "this is what [company we respect] does" + "this is the ROI" + "this is what an experiment would cost, and if it works, from there I can shut it down or scale it up" + "this is the most cost-effective solution for these reasons."

I love to work through problems together if it's useful to you.

### Coaching

I've drafted this section a few times now and always falls short on such an important topic. I expect you to coach and coach some more and be great at it. I'm here to help.

The article [The Leader as Coach](https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach) by Harvard Business Review does a much better job than I'll ever do. Read it and embrace it.

### Decision-making

I expect you to make decisions all the time as independently as possible and be right often. I expect you to ask for help or advice when you're not sure or you could use a second opinion. You're are not alone, I'm here for you.

#### Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI)

**Note:** Follow the [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/02/how-well-does-apples-directly-responsible-individual-dri-model-work-in-practice/#39e50b0a194c) for more context

Being DRI means:

* That a decision is either yours, or mine, but not both.
* You don't have to get consensus or reach to an agreement.
* The scope of my responsibility does not enclose your scope of responsibility.
* I won't override you, but I can try to persuade you.
* If you make a mistake, take accountability, and learn from it.

Being DRI does not mean:

* You get to be thoughtless.
* You're exempt from having to explain why you made a particular decision and be held accountable for it.
* You're exempt from people telling you, ahead of time or afterwards, that you made a mistake.
* You get to make decisions without attempting an agreement or include the stakeholders.
* Your choices won't be challenged.

#### Decision-making reasoning

Reasoning is using data, facts, and a formal process to decide about possible courses of action. We move fast, but the world is complex, ambiguous and unpredictable. More often than not, we can't wait to have all the information available to make a decision. We need between 50% to 70% of the information available to make a decision. Still, we must be excellent at correcting course and learning.

I tend to optimise for:

* What's the best for the customer/our people today, mid and long-term? "How does good looks like" so I have a reference point to evaluate other options.
* What's the cost of delay of making the decision?
* Can it be reversed? Will it open other possibilities in the future? How? When?
* Are we going to learn something new?

#### Decision-making intuition

Intuition is using one gut feeling to decide about possible courses of action. Although some people perceive it as a sixth sense only available to some, IMO intuition is a combination of past experience and one personal values. It is worth taking intuition into account because it reflects your learnings. It is, however, not always based on reality, only perceptions.

It's perfectly acceptable to use your intuition to make a decision that's simple in nature or needs to be made quickly. It's also perfectly acceptable to use intuition to close the gap between *knowns* and *unknowns*, and to question what the data is suggesting (e.g. Are we asking the right questions?). When your intuition is fronting the facts, try hard to validate it. Watch out for [confirmation bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-confirmation-bias-2795024).

#### 'deciding not to decide' is also a decision

Deciding not to decide also a sound decision when it is deliberate. Not making a decision might feel unnatural or even wrong. It's a valid course of action as any other, and it must always be on the table.

#### Decision-making process

I expect you to align with the following decision-making process:

* State the problem, assumptions, constraints and dependencies.
* Define how good looks like and how to measure it, so that one has a reference point.
* Define what options are available using data and facts:
  * Rank the options, E.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold
  * Be specific and clear on the pros/cons and the risks/mitigations for each option.
  * Define the success criteria for each option.
  * Define rollout, E.g. experiment, kill-switch, how to scale-up, etc.
* Anticipate the questions of the stakeholders.
* Keep yourself in check. Use your critical thinking and don't let your ego/emotions get in the way.
* Make a decision!

I found that writing a 6 or fewer pages document, less is more, for decisions that have a significant impact or must be discussed by a group works well. Keeping a decision log is also a tool that helps me understand 'why', 'what' and 'when' I've made a given decision and its quality.

#### Roadblocks and escalation

When you bump into a roadblock that you can't solve or something needs approval from high, let me know. I'll work with you. Don't get hung up on "process", upcoming meetings and such. Just-in-time escalation is usually more efficient.

#### When the decision it's not yours to make, or you weren't included, or you simply disagree with the decision

If you genuinely agree with the decision, happy days. Join forces and get it done. It is, however, harder to buy-in into a decision that you don't agree with and/or you weren't included, or you simply disagree with. While I'll always try to include you, life happens, the world is not perfect and neither I'll be looking for consensus at all costs. You're expected to:

* Provide clear and factual-based arguments why you don't agree with the decision on the right forum.
* Come up realistic alternatives.
* If the decision hasn't budged, Disagree and Commit. Stand by it and give your best to make it a success. Be a team player.

We all have those moments where we have a gut reaction “I don’t like this”, “It doesn’t make sense whatsoever”, “this is wrong”, etc. Pace yourself! Know your position first; don’t just say ‘no’ and expect others to try to convince you. Start by completing the sentence: “I [don’t agree with/don’t think we should do/don’t like] X because…”. If it doesn’t sound strong enough or right, usually is because it’s not. Think a bit more, take it off-line, and come back later with good arguments.

* [5 steps for Disagreeing Effectively](https://medium.com/@joulee/5-steps-for-disagreeing-effectively-9d745ce0dbb4)
* [Group thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) is not acceptable in any circumstances.

#### Learning from your decisions

I suggest you conduct a retrospective for every significant successful or failed decision you've made. Better when you include stakeholders. It's a powerful tool to learn.

### Communication

Communication is key to everything that we do. It's the cornerstone of trust, and trust is the bedrock of an effective and efficient relationship. It will make or break us. I don't claim to be an expert, but below I'll do my very best to describe what works for me. It's not a definite guide.

I strive to spend 10h+ of my week with my direct reports because I've found the hard way that the vast majority of issues are a result of poor or infrequent communication. We must communicate well and often.

Communicate kindly, clearly, concisely and go straight to the point (I'm working hard on these). Value people's time and they will value yours.

Empathy goes a long way, and often one doesn't know what's people's constraints, feelings and commitments before having a candid and compassionate conversation about it. Don't assume, have a conversation instead.

#### Share information openly, broadly and deliberately

Nothing to hide, all to share. Feel free to discuss things with anybody in the company. From C-levels to everyone else. If there's something wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together. Failure to address issues first with me will cost you your job because I'll perceive it as toxic office politics.

Over-communicate when you can, so that you earn credits for when you're unusually busy. If people start getting overwhelmed by the quantity, they will tell you.

Intentionally create/use communication in the right forums to share information.

Be as data-centric as possible, there's less room for interpretation and emotions tend not to get in the way.

Use your business acumen, communication goes a long way when people can relate with a solid narrative that's solving a problem.

If you're not sure if you should share something, ask before sharing. Failing to do so will have a nett negative impact on trust.

#### Optimise for data/facts/knowledge-based communication

I see opinions as *a view or judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge*. It's perfectly acceptable to share opinions. But it's important to be explicit when you're giving your opinion versus making a statement of fact, "IMO" vs "evidence shows". This will help the audience to put your remarks in perspective, and you'll be giving a positive contribution to the group with your opinion.

I tend to ask for your thoughts rather than opinions because I value the understanding of your thought process more. It's best when we both reach the same conclusions.

#### When people don't buy-in into your ideas

It's vital that you take stakeholders on a journey so that everyone has skin in the game.

 **[The Chicken and the Pig business fable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig)**
> A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road.
> The Chicken says: "Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!"
> Pig replies: "Hm, maybe, what would we call it?"
> The Chicken responds: "How about 'ham-n-eggs'?"
> The Pig thinks for a moment and says: "No, thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."

You must avoid the situation whereby you/we commit, but stakeholders are involved.

Please read [Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second-ebook/dp/B005K0AYH4/) and [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B07XRXR5PC/) if you're struggling to get buy-in.

It's crucial stakeholders trust you.

> There are three hard rules to learn…
>
> 1. You are not the exclusive source of good ideas.
> 2. There is a high chance that your ideas suck.
> 3. Even if number 2 is not true, you probably haven't gone deep enough to prove otherwise.
>
> For people to believe you, they need to trust you. For people to trust you, you need to demonstrate that you understand your subject matter to depths that they had never considered, that you have considered every conceivable alternative and edge case, that you have data to validate your hypothesis, that you have reached beyond the narrow confines of your teams and tried your hardest to disconfirm your beliefs and biases, that you understand what went before and the impact that it had.
>
> Once you get to that point, it would frankly be irresponsible not to follow your plans. Until you get to that point, you risk having the ideas of others forced upon you.

#### Words matter

Note: I'm not a native English speaker, and don't claim I excel at it. But it's something that I work on every day.

Communication tends to be vague, verbose and non-committal. This often leads to misunderstandings that can erode trust, cause inefficiencies and ultimately build resentment. We must work hard to avoid it!

Use words people understand; avoid using acronyms and [weasle words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word); be concise and straight to the point; be specific with the language you use.

Some examples of words that one should work hard to avoid using: "may", "might", "could", "can", "can be", "virtually", "up to", "as much as", "help", "like", "believe", "possibly", "endeavours", "aims to", "try", "some", "many", "most",  "almost all", "often", "I think", "I reckon", "probably" and similar qualifiers that create enough wiggle room for interpretation.

NOTE: these examples don't apply to this document because it's not supposed to be a definitive guide on how to work with me.

#### Feedback

* Feedback is critical to our success and I love it.
* At heart, Radical Candour.
* Let me know if I don't do well.
* I'll let you know if you don't.
* Performance reviews should never be a surprise for you, if it is, let me know.
* Feedback must be given often and immediately.

On our first 1:1, I'll be asking you how do you prefer to receive feedback. I like to receive feedback: promptly, objective, direct, specific and actionable.

To learn about Radical candour, follow the links and take your time to digest it:

* [What is Radical Candor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh-pG27cHtw)
* [Why 'Radical Candour' may be the key to being a successful leader](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/why-radical-candour-may-key-successful-leader/1430852).
* [INBOUND Bold Talks: Kim Scott "Radical Candor"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj9GLeNCgm4)
* [Radical Candor blog](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/)
* [Radical Candor: How to Get What You Want by Saying What You Mean](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Radical-Candor-What-Want-Saying-ebook/dp/B01LW1LESC/)

[Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):

* Safety - unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback: should be high.
* Effort - The amount of work to provide feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?": should be low.
* Benefit - how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behaviour?: should be high.

#### Staff meetings

Staff meetings occur on Monday morning with an average duration of 1.5 hours with my direct reports. It set us off for the week. It's also a forum where team members:

* Receive cross-departmental and business information.
* Get to know what's going on with each other, bounce off ideas and offer help.
* To ensure we're aligned at all times.
* To nurture team cohesion.

##### Before the meeting

To be shared 1 working day before the meeting.

* Key Indicator Report: 1-pager summary of KPIs and key delivery update shared by me.
* [Flash Reports](#Flash-reports): each team member writes their personal updates. Should working on a team assignment, the update must be provided on a weekly base.
* Deep Dive Suggestions: A deep dive is a problem-solving or new initiative slot that leverages the power of the team. Deep dives are about discussing the topic(s), not learning about it. Share a 1 to 6 pages document.

All goes into a shared document/folder where we can look back.

##### The meeting

The below format is a blueprint. All team members must be prepared for the meeting to actively and assertively contribute. Time is a scarce resource for us all. Attending and participating, it's a moral duty to your teammates and a formal duty to me.

1. Overview (5-15 min): I'll provide an overview of the KPIs, progress, sometimes go in-depth on some, and shared business or cross-department information.
2. Team members round (30 min): each team member will share with the team key achievements, disappointments, issues, concerns and learnings. What's hot on their plate. What's the plan for the week.
3. Review team assignments/actions progress (5 min)
4. Customer focus (5 min): We'll answer the questions "What are we going to do this week to enhance Customer Experience?" and "Has anyone has gone out of their way to improve Customer Experience?".
5. Deep dives (30 min to 1 hour): Discussion about problem-solving or new initiatives. This time can also be used to discuss strategy.
6. Review action items.

Meeting minute to be shared during the week and be ratified by the team members. Minute to be written by a meeting historian or by a team member in a round-robin fashion.

#### 1:1s

Our 1:1s are weekly and for 1h. Should you wish to change the frequency or length, please let me know. This is mostly your time and your agenda. I like using 1:1s to check-in on how you're doing, what you need from me, personnel issues, your professional development and performance reviews. I also use 1:1s for strategy questions that we can seed/discuss, for you to seek advice, me providing any missing context, and bi-directional feedback.

Once a quarter, we will formally document performance.

Every 2 months we'll hold a 1:1s retrospective. This way, we can continuously improve our chats.

We'll have a private online document where we collate notes from 1:1s that will help us with the retrospectives and tracking progress.

Pro tips:

* Start from where you left off.
* Prepare your topics in advance.
* I frequently use the [OSCAR model - Outcome, Situation, Choices, Actions and Review](https://www.businessballs.com/coaching-and-mentoring/oscar-model/) to assist you with your growth and development.
* Don't expect me to have everything figured out or solve the problems for you. I'm here to help you find a way forward.

**Note on career development:**
Your career is yours. You know best how you'd like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective, as well as guidance and tools. I'll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it'll be up to you to seize them. You must be growing and developing all the time.

I keep myself in check by filling a form after every 1:1:

| Criteria                                                                  | Grade  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-----: |
| Team member did most of the talking                                       | Yes/No |
| Team member displayed a sense of belonging and commitment                 | Yes/No |
| Team member is exhibiting proof of growth and development                 | Yes/No |
| Team member and I were aligned on takeaways                               | Yes/No |
| Team member left with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation           | Yes/No |
| Team member talked about things that are not going well                   | Yes/No |
| Team member's perspectives match with what I've seen and heard elsewhere  | Yes/No |

#### Plans Vs. Planning

I expect you to plan and to share your plans in writing. Plans not written down and shared don't exist.

> If you don't have a plan, you become part of somebody else's plan - Terence McKenna.

Plans must be clear and specific prompting commitment by the stakeholders.

> everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth - Mike Tyson.

Things usually don't go according to the plan, and that's OK.

> In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable - Dwight D. Eisenhower.

It's about thinking ahead that get us to be better prepared for plan deviations.

#### Delivery reporting

Create a regular, systematic, clearly framed written process by which you share your progress against plan progress, RAG, risks/mitigations, assumptions and issues/blockers. Share this update with me no less frequently than weekly. I place a high premium on data and well-thought mitigation actions. Should something is RED for more than a couple of weeks, it becomes the focus on my attention, and you should be all over it to find *the path to GREEN.*

Perhaps {company_X} has a delivery department or something similar. I expect you to work closely with them and be accountable for the quality and accuracy of what's being reported of your teams.

#### Flash reports

Flash reports are delivered to me weekly, 1 working day before the Staff Meeting. It must be clearly written, concise, and specific.

Format:
Email subject: Flash report dd/MM/yyyy

* Key achievements.
* Issues for visibility.
* Need help.
* My assignments progress.

#### What to do when you get a message from me

I don't expect you to respond to everything in real-time, but do expect you to close the loop on everything we open in a timely manner. If it's on my plate, I will do the same. I get frustrated when I have to ask about something twice or if I'm asked about something that we've agreed you should have come back to me with.

I like fast turnaround and acknowledgement on written communications like "got it" or "on it" type acknowledgement so I know things that we're discussing are moving.

I tend to send quite a few of FYI so that you're in the loop. There's no need to reply unless you have a simple question that can't be discussed on other forums.

If you're CC'ed, I'm not expecting you to reply, but it's perfectly acceptable that you choose to do so. Just be conscious that you're jumping on someone else conversation.

### Get a hold on me

I'm usually quite busy, and it's hard to find me at my desk. I will always make myself available if you need me. Some tips that can help you get a hold on me:

* Emergency: find me at my desk or around the office -> call me -> text me -> slack me -> drop me an email. Do whatever you need to do to get a hold on me.
* Urgent matter: text me -> slack me -> drop me an email.
* Important matter: slack me -> drop me an email.
* BAU: drop me an email -> book a meeting

If you suggest a meeting or discussion, initiate finding time on my diary and make the appointment. If I suggest a discussion, I will do the same. Don't say "let's discuss" without a quick follow-up of when we'll discuss.

### Leadership

I'm a big fan of [Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles). Therefore you'll see me using them often within our context. Please get familiar with them and reach out if you'd like to discuss it further.

Lead by example, show don't tell.

#### Everyone is a leader and leadership comes from everywhere

I expect different team members to step into leadership roles, contribute, and step back once the need for their specific skills has passed. We must pull out leaders from everywhere. It's vital to scale the org; give opportunities for people to grow and develop; use the best people for the job; etc.

I expect you to pull out leaders from everywhere and continually.

#### A Leadership Primer

From [General Colin Powell, Chairman (Ret), Joint Chiefs of Staff. 18](http://govleaders.org/powell.htm) valuable lessons that you should be aware of. Some are really close to my heart:

* Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off.
* The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.
* Organisation doesn't really accomplish anything. Plans don't accomplish anything, either. Theories of management don't much matter. Endeavours succeed or fail because of the people involved. **Only by attracting the best people will you accomplish great deeds.**
* Organisation charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing.
* Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.
* The commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong unless proved otherwise.

#### The 21 irrefutable laws of leadership

I'm a big fan of John C. Maxwell books on leadership. Get familiar with the: [The 21 irrefutable laws Of leadership](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00ETK5N5O). You can also find a good summary [here.](http://hgimnetwork.org/2015/01/book-summary-the-21-irrefutable-laws-of-leadership-by-john-maxwell-part-1/)

#### Command & control or authoritative leadership style (AKA top-down)

Is not advisable! Only when a team is in *survival mode* and for a short period, I'll not question your judgement. I also appreciate a heads-up when you feel is needed.

#### Union Vs. Business Vs. Servant Leader

You are a Business Leader, not a Union Leader. You must represent and serve your team(s) to set them to succeed, but it must be in alignment with the {company_X} context.

To be a business leader is to be a servant leader:
> As stated by its founder, Robert K. Greenleaf, a Servant Leader should be focused on, "Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?" When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they benefit as well as their employees in that their employees acquire personal growth, while the organization grows as well due to the employees growing commitment and engagement.
source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership>

Union leaders demand or commit or rally people into popular but unrealistic requests, usually around the company resources or ways of working. This is not advisable, and it's likely to cost you your job. If you can't gauge if the request is unrealistic, ask first. It will save us both a great deal of pain. [Use me as a resource of sound judgement](###Me-as-a-resource)

I expect you to set expectations and context for everyone in your team so that we achieve a robust alignment, and the temptation to embody Union leader traits is low.

### Technology

So, you're a manager. It means you don't need to be technical anymore. You're a **Software Engineering Manager**. I don't expect you to code, but I expect you to be a technologist and be able to influence technical decisions. You must understand what your people do to earn their trust and to provide them with what they need to be successful.

#### Technology general principles

* Our #1 priority is service continuity. We prioritise availability, scalability, regulatory requirements, and the resolution of defects that block customers from using core functionality or our best value ahead of other initiatives, even when that decision is uncomfortable.
* We design, build, and maintain complete solutions, through quick and short iterations that enable and take advantage of experimentation.
* Work done is better than work in progress. Working software in front of the customer is better than software in the development phase.
* We take great pride in 'what' and 'how' we deliver software to our customers. QA, Security, Ops, engineering culture and product success is everyone responsibility.
* We take it as an article of faith that the compounding of continually improving small things through sort and quick iterations is the best decision long-term.
* We thrive in intentional failing-fast and experimenting within a controlled and acceptable blast radius. We learn this way significantly, and we share our learnings, so others learn as well. We'll never deliberately put the trust of our customers at odds. We have tolerance ZERO for blame.
* Software Engineering is craftsmanship in the service of the customer. We contribute to outcomes, not results. By being focus on customer outcomes, we do our best work, and we'll be engaged throughout.
* We'll make tactical moves and manage tech debt as a token of gratitude for the customer. However, a high bar must be cleared before approving tactical moves.

#### Pragmatic Craftsmanship

Software Engineering is a craft, but it doesn't have an end on itself in a business context. Software exists to serve the customer.

I always ask: If a team member were to be alerted at 4 am on a Friday to deal with an incident will she/he be able to identify, test and ship the fix by 4:30 am with a sense of fulfilled duty? If not, the team must get the system in a state that enables it.

There are times when we need to make tactical moves to fulfil customer expectations. When it happens, the technical debt must be managed and be paid off ASAP.

Non Functional Requirements must be threaded carefully. There's little value on a system that doesn't work on specific situations, often when a high volume of users expects to use the system at the same time.

#### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence to me is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures at pace. **Operational Excellence is exceptionally close to my heart.** I expect you to have it front and centre as it's key to meet customer expectations.

Design Principles:

* Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
* Create paved roads aggressively: tools, processes, etc.
* Everything as code.
* Refine operations procedures frequently and relentlessly.
* Anticipate failure: pre-mortem, Production Readiness Reviews, etc.
* Learn from all operational failures: post-mortem, retrospectives, sharing findings with all the Engineering group , etc.

#### Dependencies

Best dependencies are no dependency. Aggressively kill dependencies. I rather have 2 of the same than 0 of nothing or 1 that takes much longer.

Teams should be able to carry out their mission without having to coordinate outside the team. When it's not possible, I expect you to actively establish processes that enable the teams to coordinate efficiently. At the same time, we must kill inter-teams dependencies.

#### Innovation

Innovation comes from everyone, everywhere and at any time. When possible and on the remit of your team, apply "small, fast and measurable" iterations and get on with it. Share the findings when you're ready.

When innovation requires extensive work that impacts the product roadmap and/or other teams, it has to be discussed across Tech and/or Product. Put it down in writing so that we can have an asynchronous conversation first. I very fun of A3 thinking that's usually used to find root causes issues. I find the template quite useful in tech. Still, I'm open to any format that you find helpful to express the idea.

TIP: Be pedantic and technically sound.

## Some points on hiring and managing your team

One of your most important jobs is to recruit incredibly high-quality talent. Collaborate with me on your new hires - direct reports. These are ultimately your decision, but I hold veto power (that I will use judiciously). I will want more involvement in your first hire, than your second, than your third, than your fourth, etc.

Share with me your team management system — where different from the company — how you communicate the vision, set goals, create alignment, foster high engagement, and cultural nuances/recruiting practices/performance review processes that are unique to your team.

I'll push you to push out poor performers and get frustrated when we take too long to act. Be fair with terminations and don't surprise the person you're letting go. People who are let go must leave with their respect intact.

Recognize and support your top performers. Help me help you recognise your top performers.

Don't surprise me with employee departures. We should know about these before they happen.

Be explicit about team norms that aren't held companywide. It's OK if some norms differ between teams. Just be explicit about it and make sure they don't collide with company values.
