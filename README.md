# Bruno's manager README



# Disclaimer
This document *MUST* not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division, team or manager of ${company_X}. You might find that my beliefs and style might not be completely aligned and sometimes even incompatible with what you find throughout the business and that’s OK! This is a document on me and it applies to me only.

# Welcome
I’m very happy to welcome you. You will work at ${company_X}, where I hope it becomes a place where you’ll grow, have fun and contribute. I’m also hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm the journey gets easier for all of us.

I look forward to working with you. 

**Welcome to the team!**

# Motivations behind this document?
Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager’s README, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress and it’s meant to be documentation on me.

Few reasons for this document to exist:
* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, expectations and self-awareness
* You should know as much as possible how interfacing with me looks like. Does “loosely in coupling and high in cohesion” rings a bell?
* To share my expectations for what I believe is the most effective way for us to work
* For you to help me improve and **holding me accountable**
* Reduce managerial overhead on both sides. You don’t need to put too much effort on “managing up” and I don’t have to “manage down”, win-win. 
* Hopefully, this will help us work better together

**Important**: this document is *NOT* meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We’ll learn more about each other organically.

Btw, have you noticed the repo license is MIT? What can this possibly mean?
