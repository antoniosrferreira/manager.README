# Bruno's manager README



# Disclaimer
This document *MUST* not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division, team or manager of ${company_X}. You might find that my beliefs and style might not be completely aligned and sometimes even incompatible with what you find throughout the business and that’s OK! This is a document on me and it applies to me only.

# Welcome
I’m very happy to welcome you. You will work at ${company_X}, where I hope it becomes a place where you’ll grow, have fun and contribute. I’m also hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm the journey gets easier for all of us.

I look forward to working with you. 

**Welcome to the team!**

# Motivations behind this document
Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager’s README, I’ve decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You might find my document close to those you find online and sometimes a copy & paste and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress and it’s meant to be documentation on me.

Few reasons for this document to exist:
* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, expectations and self-awareness
* You should know as much as possible how interfacing with me looks like. Does “loosely in coupling and high in cohesion” rings a bell?
* To share my expectations for what I believe is the most effective way for us to work
* For you to help me improve and **holding me accountable**
* Reduce managerial overhead on both sides. You don’t need to put too much effort on “managing up” and I don’t have to “manage down”, win-win. 
* Hopefully, this will help us work better together

**Important**: this document is *NOT* meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We’ll learn more about each other organically.

Btw, have you noticed the repo license is MIT? What can this possibly mean?

# Hi, I'm Bruno
I was born in Porto, Portugal in 1983 where I lived for 24 years before moving to Lisbon and 5 years later to London. I’m a father to baby boy and partner to a wonderful woman that balances my life. As you will find, I’m a bit of a workaholic. I like to travel, to meet new people – people are the colour of life –, good food, watch TV series & films, read technical, business, economics and management books/news/articles/posts, cars (fast cars!), tennis, coding (yes I still code!), long walks and spending time with my family. My partner says that I spend all the time moving from a screen to another – from my laptop to my work phone, to my personal phone, to my TV, to my kindle… You’ll find me listening to Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Moby quite often, it won’t affect my mood!

I’m a by-product of several variables: genetics, family & social relationships, the context/environment that I’m currently at and scar tissue (AKA experience). Some of the traits that have been flagged to me over the years are forthright, upright, committed, hard-working, driven, obsessed by learning & winning and loyal.

Some of my quirks while working:
* I’m all-in, always on, all the time. I don’t expect you to follow my example and I recommend that you don’t. That’s just how I work best.
* I have very little patience for apathy and indifference, if something is going on, let me know ASAP.
* I have very little patience for B.S., corporate culture, “box tickers” and “talk and no walk”.
* My language skills degrade fast as I get tired.
* I talk a lot. If you get lost, call it out. I also tend to repeat myself because I feel I wasn’t clear enough. I know is annoying. I’m trying to improve by optimising for effectiveness and within it, I’ll try to be as kind as possible.
* You most likely will get emails or slack messages over the weekends or late at night or on holidays. Don’t feel compelled to reply, I’m not expecting it from you! It’s just me being ON all the time.
* I bias toward transparency and radical candour. You can ask anything. Most of the time you’ll get an answer. Sometimes I can’t but I'm committed to never lie to you.
* I heavily bias towards action. There’s value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and fast iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast / learn-fast) and make visible progress. 

If you’re curious about my professional experience please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunotavares/) where you’ll find that I’ve used a lot of different hats (sometimes simultaneous), across several LOBs and vastly different companies sizes. Tech & people at the spotlight.
