# Bruno's manager README

## Disclaimer

This document **MUST** not be read in any way that applies to any other group, division, team or manager of ${company_X}. If you find that my beliefs and style are not wholly aligned or are even incompatible with what you observe in {company_X} and that's OK! This is a document on me, and it applies to me only.

## Welcome

I'm pleased to welcome you. You will work at ${company_X}, where I hope it becomes a place where you'll grow, have fun and contribute. I'm also hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm, the journey gets easier for all of us.

I look forward to working with you.

**Welcome to the team!**

## Motivations behind this document

Having been inspired by several documents/posts on the importance of a Manager's README, I've decided to kick things off on Github with my own edition. You will find my document close to those you encounter online and sometimes a copy & paste, and that's OK, it just means I couldn't put it in better words.

This document will always be a work in progress, and it's meant to be documentation on me.

Few reasons for this document to exist:

* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, expectations and self-awareness
* You should know as much as possible how interfacing with me looks like. Does "loosely in coupling and high in cohesion" rings a bell?
* To share my expectations for what I believe is the most effective way for us to work
* For you to help me improve and **holding me accountable**
* Reduce managerial overhead on both sides. You don't need to put too much effort on "managing up", and I don't have to "manage down", win-win.
* Hopefully, this will help us work better together

**Important**: this document is *NOT* meant as a replacement for us getting to know each other! We'll learn more about each other organically.

Btw, have you noticed the repo license is MIT? What can this possibly mean?

## Hi, I'm Bruno

I was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1983, where I lived for 24 years before moving to Lisbon and 5 years later to London. I'm a father to a baby boy and partner to a wonderful woman that balances my life. As you will find, I'm a bit of a workaholic. I like to travel; to meet new people – people are the colour of life; good food; watch TV series & films; read technical, business, economics and management books/news/articles/posts; cars (fast cars!); tennis; coding (yes I still code!); long walks and spending time with my family. My partner says that I spend all my time moving from a screen to another – from my laptop to my work phone, to my personal phone, to my TV, to my kindle…

I'm a by-product of several variables: genetics, family & social relationships, the context/environment that I'm currently at and scar tissue (AKA experience). Some of the traits that have been flagged to me over the years are forthright, upright, committed, hard-working, driven, obsessed by learning & winning and loyal.

Some of my quirks while working:

* I'm all-in, always-on, all the time. I don't expect you to follow my example and I recommend that you don't. That's just how I work best.
* I have very little patience for apathy and indifference, if something is going on, let me know ASAP.
* I have very little patience for BS, toxic culture, "box tickers" and "talk and no walk".
* I have very little patience for Union Leaders.
* My communication skills degrade as I get tired.
* I tend to talk a bit too much. I know it is annoying, please call it out. I'm trying to improve by optimising for effectiveness, and within it, I'll try to be as kind as possible.
* You most likely will get emails or slack messages over the weekends or late at night or on holidays. Don't feel compelled to reply, I'm not expecting it from you! It's just me being ON all the time.
* I'm biased towards transparency and radical candour. You can ask me anything. Most of the time, you'll get an answer. Sometimes I can't, but I'm committed to never lie to you.
* I'm heavily biased towards action. There's value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and fast iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast / learn-fast) and make visible progress.

## My job

As a Software Engineering Manager, my job is to:

* Foster and nurture a strong and healthy Software Engineering culture founded on great people, Operational Excellence and customer-centricity
* Help ${company_X} processes & technology so that we can have a scalable organisation by:
  * Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you).
  * Coach & Mentor teams and individuals.
  * Reduce managerial overhead, establish processes and streamline existing processes.
* We have a "default to yes" mindset while providing clear tradeoff to relevant stakeholders. We can do anything Product wants!
* Get everybody to focus on the Customer.
* Make tie-breaking decisions.
* Put in place checks & balances.
* Help to develop ${company_X} Engineering brand.
* Set context so that you can connect the dots on what ${company_X} needs, understand what's your priority & focus and what you need to be successful.
* Help you to build effective relationships with others in the company so you can be as self-sufficient as possible.
* Provide technical advice when required.

## How do I manage

### General principles

* You work for ${company_X} not for me, always optimise for the company.
* You're my top priority, so should be every one that reports to you.
* I serve you, not the other way around.
* Customers at the forefront and centre of everything that we do.
* I make as few decisions as possible. Still, not a democracy.
* Teams are autonomous, self-organised and ultimately self-directed.
* We work as one team, delivering on time and with high quality.
* ICs and teams impact, development and growth is notable, quarter over quarter.
* We move fast, very fast.
* If I do something that's impacting my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP
* If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting the context, you'd be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP.
* I'm making mistakes, please let me know and hold me accountable!

### How do I measure the success of our team

* Customer's quantitative and qualitative feedback about features we ship is positive, e.g. NPS, active usage, etc.
* We're strong contributors to the {company_X} objectives and key results.
* Team health is high.
* Everyone well-being is high.

### Decision-making

I expect you to make decisions all the time as autonomous as possible and be right often. I also expect you to ask for help or advice when you're not sure or you could use a second opinion. You're are not alone, I'm here for you.

#### Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI)

**Note:** Follow [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/02/how-well-does-apples-directly-responsible-individual-dri-model-work-in-practice/#39e50b0a194c) for more context

Being DRI means:

* That a decision is either yours, or mine, but not both.
* You don't have to get consensus, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't actively seek for it. You should have a good reason for not getting it and be able to articulate it when requested.
* You don't have to reach an agreement, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't actively seek for it. You should have a good reason for not getting it and be able to articulate it when requested.
* The scope of my responsibility does not enclose your scope of responsibility
* I cannot override you, but I can try to persuade you
* If you make a mistake, you fix it, don't wait for someone to tell you

Being DRI does not mean:

* You get to be thoughtless
* You're exempt from having to explain why you made a particular decision
* You're exempt from people telling you, ahead of time or afterwards, that you made a mistake.
* Your choices won't be challenged by other stakeholders

#### Decision-making reasoning

Reasoning is using data, facts and process to decide about possible courses of action. We strive to move fast, but the world surrounding us is complex, ambiguous and uncertain. More often than not, we can't wait to have all the information available to make a decision. Still, we need to make it. The formula that I use embraces that we make decisions in imperfect conditions. In essence, we need 70% of the information to make a decision, but we need to be great at correcting course and learning (can't remember where I've learned this from).

I tend to optimise for:

* What's the best for the Customer today, mid and long term? "How does good looks like" so I have a reference point to evaluate other options.
* What's the cost of delay of making the decision?
* Can it be reversed? Will it open other possibilities in the future? How? When?
* Are we going to learn something new?

Decisions logs are great, give it a go.

#### Decision-making intuition

Intuition is using your 'gut feeling' about possible courses of action. Although some people perceive it as something magical 'sense' only available to some, IMHO intuition is a combination of past experience and your personal values. It is worth taking intuition into account because it reflects your learnings. It is, however, not always based on reality, only your perceptions. I've found writing down my thoughts and seeking data to back it up helps me being right more often. The process will help with being more often right than wrong.

It's perfectly acceptable to use your intuition to make a decision that's simple in nature or needs to be made quickly.

#### 'deciding not to decide' is also a decision

Deciding not to decide is perhaps one of the toughest decisions one can make. After all, we're expected to make decisions and to act! Not making a decision might feel unnatural or even wrong at times. It's a valid decision as any other, and it should always be on the table. It should follow the same decision-making process as any other decision.

#### Decision-making process

* Write it down with 6 or fewer pages. Less is more!
* State the problem, assumptions, constraints and risks.
* Simplify, simplify simplify! Challenge everything! Model the problem!
* Define how good looks like.
* What are the options available to us today.
* Define risk mitigations.
* Focus on the data and outcomes.
* Keep yourself in check. Don't let your ego/emotions get in the way.

Make a decision!

#### Roadblocks and escalation

When you bump into a roadblock that you can't solve or something needs approval from high, let me know. I'll work with you. Don't get hung up on "process", upcoming meetings and such. Just-in-time escalation is usually more efficient.

#### When the decision it's not yours to make, or you weren't included

If you agree with the decision, happy days. Joins forces and get it done. It is, however, harder to buy-in into a decision that you don't agree with or you weren't included. While I'll always try to include you, life happens, the world is not perfect. You're expected to:

* Express clearly why you don't agree with the decision on the right forum.
* Provide clear, factual based and valid alternatives.
* Be a team player.
* If the decision hasn't changed, Disagree and Commit. Stand by it to the end while giving your best to make it a success.

#### Learning

I suggest you conduct a retrospective for each significant successful or failed decision you've made. Better when you include stakeholders. It's a powerful tool to learn and be more self-aware of your actions.

### Communication

Communication is key to everything that we do. It's the cornerstone of trust, and trust is the bedrock of an effective and efficient relationship. It will make or break us. I don't claim to be an expert. Moreover, there's tons of literature about it. Below I'll do my very best to describe what works for me, but it's not a definite guide.

I strive to spend 10h of my week with my direct reports because I've found the hard way that the vast majority of issues are a result of poor or infrequent communication. We must communicate well and often.

Communicate clearly, concisely and go straight to the point (I'm working hard on these). Value people's time and they will value yours. Be forthright and upright, but don't forget to be kind. Empathy goes a long way, and often one doesn't know what's people's constraints and feelings before having a candid and compassionate conversation about it.

#### Share information openly, broadly and deliberately

Nothing to hide, all to share. Feel free to discuss things with anybody in the business. From C-levels to everyone else. If there's something wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together. Failure to address issues first with me will cost you your job because I'll perceive it as toxic office politics.

Default to share everything. Deliberately create/use communication forums to share information. Use the right forums to capture the attention of the right audience. Be as data-driven as possible, there's less room for interpretation and emotions tend not to get in the way. And use your business acumen, comms go a long way when people can relate with a solid narrative that's aiming to solve a Customer problem. When one failed to do so, is often considered "noise" or office politics.

Over-communicate when you can, so that you earn credits when you're particularly busy. If people start getting overwhelmed by the qua will tell you, and you adjust if needed.

#### Optimise for communication-based on facts and knowledge

I perceive opinions as *a view or judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge*. It's perfectly acceptable to share opinions. But it's important to be explicit when you're giving your opinion vs making a statement of facts, "IMO" vs "data shows". This will help the recipient to put your remarks in perspective. I tend to ask for your thoughts rather than opinions because I value the understanding of your thought process more. It's great when we both reach the same conclusions.

#### Words matter

Note: I'm not a native English speaker, and I'll not claim I'm particularly good at it. But it's something that I work on every day.

Communication tends to be vague, verbose and non-committal. This often leads to misunderstandings that can erode trust, cause inefficiencies and ultimately build resentment. We must work hard to avoid it!

Use words people understand; avoid using acronyms and [weasle words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word); be concise and straight to the point; be specific with the language you use.

Some examples of words that one should work hard to avoid using: "may", "might", "could", "can", "can be", "virtually", "up to", "as much as", "help", "like", "believe", "possibly", "endeavours", "aims to", "try", "some", "many", "most",  "almost all", "often", "I think", "I reckon", "probably" and similar qualifiers that create enough wiggle room for a rhino. NOTE: these examples don't apply to this document because it's not suppose to be a definite guide how to work with me.

#### Feedback

* Feedback is critical to our success and I love it.
* Radical Candour at its heart.
* [Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):
  * Safety - unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback: should be high.
  * Effort - The amount of work to provide feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?": should be low.
  * Benefit - how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behaviour?: should be high.
* Let me know if I don't do well.
* I'll let you know if you don't.
* Performance reviews should never be a surprise for you, if it is, let me know.
* Feedback must be given often.

On our first 1:1, I'll be asking you how do you prefer to receive feedback. I like feedback to provide to me to be blunt, objective, specific, immediate and actionable.

#### Staff meetings

Staff meetings occur on Monday morning with a duration of 1.5 hours with my direct reports. It set us for the week, and focus on [How do I measure the success of our team](#How-do-I-measure-the-success-of-our-team). It's also a forum where team members:
* Cross-departmental and business information sharing.
* Get to know what's going on with each other and offer help.
* To ensure we're aligned at all times
* To nurture team cohesion. Together we're stronger.

##### Before the meeting

To be shared 1 working day before the meeting.

* Key Indicator Report: 1-pager summary of the group core metrics and delivery update shared by me.
* Team member updates or Flash Reports: each team member writes their personal updates. Should working on a team assignment update must be provided.
* Deep Dive Suggestions: A deep dive is a problem-solving slot or new initiative that leverages the power of the team. Deep dives are about discussing the topic, not learning about it. Please prepare the deep dive as you'd with the [decision-making process](#Decision-making-process).

All goes into a shared document where we can always look back.

##### The meeting

The below format is a blueprint. We'll find what works best for us as we go along. All team members must come prepared to the meeting to actively contribute. Time is a scarce resource, attending and participating in the session; it's a moral duty to your teammates.

1. Overview (5-15 min): I'll provide an overview of the KPIs, progress, sometimes go in-depth on some, and shared business or cross-department information.
2. Team members round (30 min): each team member will share with the team key achievements, disappointments, issues, concerns and learnings. What's hot on their plate. What's the plan for the week to move us forward.
3. Review team assignments/actions progress (5 min)
4. Customer focus (5 min): We'll answer the questions "What are we going to do differently this week to enhance Customer Experience?" and "Has anyone has gone out of their way to improve Customer Experience?".
5. Decisions to be discussed or assignments to be handed over (20 min)
6. Deep dives (30 min): Discussion about problem-solving or new initiatives. This time can also be used to discuss strategy.
7. Review action items.

Meeting minute to be shared during the week and be ratified by the team members.

#### 1:1s

Our 1:1s are weekly and for 1h. Should you wish to change the frequency or length, please let me know. This is mostly your time and your agenda. I like using 1:1s to check-in on how you're doing, what you need from me, personnel issues, your professional development and performance reviews. I also use 1:1s for strategy questions that we can seed/discuss, for you to seek advice, me providing any missing context, and bi-directional feedback.

Once a quarter, we will formally document performance.

Every 2 months we'll hold a 1:1s retrospective. This way, we can continuously improve the one-on-ones.

We'll have a private online document where we collate notes from 1:1s that will help us with the retrospectives and tracking progress.

Pro tips:

* Start from where you left off.
* Prepare your topics in advance.
* I frequently use the [OSCAR model - Outcome, Situation, Choices, Actions and Review](https://www.businessballs.com/coaching-and-mentoring/oscar-model/) to assist you with your growth and development.
* Don't expect me to have everything figured out or solve the problems for you. I'm here to help you find a way forward.

Note on career development:
Your career is yours. You know best how you'd like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective as well as guidance and tools. Let me know what interests you and where you want to go. I'll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it'll be up to you to seize them. You must be growing and developing all the time. If you don't take significant time and effort to improve yourself, you won't be able to grow and develop your org.

I keep myself in check by filling a form after every 1:1:

| Criteria                                                                  | Grade  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-----: |
| Team member did most of the talking                                       | Yes/No |
| Team member displayed a sense of belonging and commitment                 | Yes/No |
| Team member is exhibiting signs of growth and development                 | Yes/No |
| Team member and I were aligned on takeaways                               | Yes/No |
| Team member left with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation             | Yes/No |
| Team member's perspectives match with what I've seen and heard elsewhere  | Yes/No |

#### Reporting

Create a regular, systematic, clearly framed written process by which you share your progress against plan progress, RAG, risks/mitigations, assumptions and issues/blockers. Share this update with me no less frequently than weekly. I place a high premium on data and well-thought mitigation actions. Should something is RED for more than a couple of weeks, it becomes the focus on my attention, and you should be all over it to find *the path to GREEN.*

Perhaps {company_X} has a delivery department or something alike, I expect you to work closely with them and be accountable for what's being reported. In this case, your report to me doesn't need to include Delivery related information. It should focus on what's going on the ground (e.g. acquisition and retention of talent, people issues, facilities issues, etc.) and how are you progressing with your OKRs/Goals.

#### What to do when you get a message from me

I don't expect you to respond to everything in real-time, but do expect you to close the loop on everything we open in a timely manner. If it's on my plate, I will do the same, but try to take things that are in your function off my plate and into your management/organisation/prioritisation system. I get frustrated when I have to ask about something twice or if I'm asked about something that we've agreed you should have come back to me.

I like fast turnaround and acknowledgement on written communications like "got it" or "on it" type acknowledgement so I know things that we're discussing are moving.

I tend to send quite a few of FYI so that you're in the loop. There's no need to reply unless you have a simple question that can't be discussed on other forums.

If you're CC'ed, I'm not expecting you to reply, but it's perfectly acceptable that you choose to do so. Just be conscious that you're jumping on someone else conversation.

#### Get a hold on me

I'm usually quite busy, and it's hard to find me at my desk. I will always make myself available if you need me. Some tips that can help you get a hold on me:

* Emergency: find me at my desk or around the office -> call me -> text me -> slack me -> drop me an email. Do whatever you need to do to get a hold on me.
* Urgent matter: text me -> slack me -> drop me an email.
* Important matter: slack me -> drop me an email.
* BAU: drop me an email -> book a meeting

If you suggest a meeting or discussion, initiate finding time on my diary and make an appointment on my calendar. If I suggest a discussion, I will begin finding the time. Don't say "let's discuss" without a quick follow-up of when we'll discuss.

### Leadership

I'm a big fan of [Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles). Get familiar with them, I expect you to incorporate it on your behaviours. If not possible on {company_X} let's have a chat about it.

Lead by example, show don't tell!

#### Everyone is a leader and leadership comes from everywhere

Leadership is not just for managers. You'll find throughout your career that management is orthogonal to leadership. I expect different team members will need to step into leadership roles, contribute, and step back once the need for their specific skills has passed. It's our job to pull out leaders from everywhere.

#### A Leadership Primer

From General Colin Powell, Chairman (Ret), Joint Chiefs of Staff. 18 valuable lessons that you should be aware of (<http://govleaders.org/powell.htm).> Some are really close to my heart:

* "Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off."
* "The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership."
* "Organization doesn't really accomplish anything. Plans don't accomplish anything, either. Theories of management don't much matter. Endeavours succeed or fail because of the people involved. **Only by attracting the best people will you accomplish great deeds.**"
* "Organization charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing."
* "Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier."
* "The commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong unless proved otherwise." (lead from the trenches)

#### Command & control or authoritative leadership style (AKA top-down)

Is not advisable! Only when a team is in *survival mode* and for a short period, I'll not question if your judgement is sound. I also appreciate a heads-up when you feel is needed.

#### Servant leader

It is highly desirable, you should always strive for it. Still, it requires yourself and the team a great deal of maturity, or stuff doesn't get done and "too many cooks in the kitchen" syndrome creeps in. Sometimes one who wants to be a servant leader can easily fall into an absent leader. Be thoughtful about how to take your team on the journey. Does this mean the team just does whatever they want, and the manager has no say? No. You and your team work **together** to define and prioritise impactful work with the rest of the stakeholders, including product managers, designers, and others and in line with business priorities.

#### Union vs Business Leader

You are a Business Leader, not a Union Leader. You must represent your teams and ICs, but it must be put in the business context. Voicing or demanding or committing popular but unrealistic requests are not advisable. I expect you to set expectations and business context for everyone in your org so that we're all aligned, and you stand by it. Also, note the {company_X} is not the other cool company with all the cool things.

### Technology

So, you're a manager in tech. It means you don't need to be technical anymore. **WRONG!!!** You're an Engineering Manager, I don't expect you to code, but I expect you to be passionate about technology, be a technologist. You must understand what your people do to earn their trust and to provide them with what they and the business need to be successful.

> Dive Deep
> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are sceptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
> [Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)

Our #1 priority is service continuity. We prioritise availability, scalability, regulatory requirements, and the resolution of defects that block customers from using {company_X} products ahead of other initiatives, even when that decision is uncomfortable. We design, build, and maintain complete solutions, through quick and short iterations that enable experimentation. There's little value on working on something for far too long without learning if our customers will benefit.

Work done is better than work in progress. Working software in front of the Customer is better than software in development.

#### Pragmatic Craftsmanship

Software Development is a craft, but it doesn't have an end on itself in a business context. Software exists to serve our customers.

I always ask: If a team member were to be awake at 4 am on a Friday night to deal with an incident will she/he be able to identify, test and ship the fix by 4:30 am with a sense of fulfilled duty? If not, the team must get the system in a state that enables it.

There are times when we need to make tactical moves to fulfil customer expectations when it happens, the technical debt must be paid off ASAP.

Non Functional Requirements must be threaded carefully. There's little value on a system that doesn't work on specific situations, often when a high volume of users expects to use the system at the same time.

#### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence to me is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures at pace. Operational Excellence is very close to my heart. I expect you to have it front and centre on your mind as it's key to meet customer expectations.

Design Principles:

* Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
* Create paved roads aggressively: tools, processes, etc.
* Everything as code.
* Refine operations procedures frequently and relentlessly.
* Anticipate failure: pre-mortem, Production Readiness Reviews, etc.
* Learn from all operational failures. Celebrate failure with us all.

#### Dependencies

Best dependencies are no dependency. Aggressively strangle dependencies. I rather have 2 of the same than 0 of nothing.

Teams should be able to carry out their mission without having to coordinate outside the team. When it's not possible, I expect you to actively find asynchronous and fast processes that enable the team to move fast and autonomy.

#### Innovation

Innovation comes from everyone, everywhere and at any time. When possible and on the remit of your team, apply "small, fast and measurable" iterations and get on with it. Share the findings when you're ready.

When innovation requires extensive work that impacts the product roadmap and/or other teams, it has to be discussed across Tech and/or Product. To have a productive discussion, you and your team should put it down in writing so that we can have an asynchronous conversation. I very fun of A3 thinking that's usually used to find root causes issues. I find the template quite useful for any meaningful change. Still, I'm open to any format that you find helpful to express the idea.

[A3 template](https://www.crisp.se/gratis-material-och-guider/a3-template)

The document should provide a high-level view of the innovation and then go down into the details.

TIP: Be pedantic and technically sound.

## What I believe

Below you'll find my core beliefs.

**I believe** that teams are more important than superstars. Although it is always good to have around superstars so that we can learn from them.

**I believe** in Directly-Responsible Individual (DRI).

**I believe** teams are gown not hired.

**I believe** experimentation as a constant practice for learning. Experiment with people, tools, processes and environment.

**I believe** (strongly!) on Conway's law: "any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose is a copy of the organisation communication structure". ${company_X} future partially depends on how well and often we communicate, let's optimise for it.

**I believe** QA, Security, Ops, Culture and Product success is everyone responsibility!

**I believe** in short feedback loops, fail-fast and reduced blast radius. It's OK to fail as long as we learn the lesson and share our learnings. Tolerance ZERO for blame!

**I believe** data tells us a great deal. Be data-driven but don't lose your gut feeling, you'll need it at the end.

**I believe** in the compounding of continually improving small things through sort and quick iterations.

**I believe** that delivery velocity is largely determined by how well everyone understands where we are, where everyone is and where we're going (context). Chances are people will self-organise to move in the right direction and take ownership of their delivery. As a result, they will figure out ways to move faster.

**I believe** in Agile, Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery core principles. They are tools, don't make a great deal of the tools, make a great deal of what you build!

**I believe** that there's no such thing as personality conflicts at work. We may have disagreements, and that's OK, it's not personal. I'll always try to adjust to personalities styles and you should too.

**I believe** that processes do add value when kept to a minimum and enable teams to work at its best. I need specific procedures in place to be able to manage up and out to the rest of the business. If you ever have feedback on the process(es), please let me know. Btw, processes need to be monitored like any other system. If one can't describe a process in less than 1min, no one will follow it.

## The team

* Always question, always ask "why?"
* Constantly learn
