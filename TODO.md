* Autonomy


I try to take things that are in your function off my plate and into your management/organisation/prioritisation system. 

* Leadership is behaviour, not a position. Actions speak louder than words.
* Teams are autonomous, self-organised and ultimately self-directed.
* We work as one team, delivering on time and with high quality.
* ICs and teams impact, development and growth is notable, quarter over quarter.
* If I do something that's impacting my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP
* If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting the context, you'd be doing me a huge favour if you let me know ASAP.







In these cases, finding leaders who fit the current culture is not the goal. Evolving the culture requires having leaders in key roles who explicitly don’t fit the current culture, but more closely align with the culture the organization is trying to foster. A company undergoing a digital transformation for example, may want a change agent who can model a more inquisitive, adaptive, bold and action-oriented culture. Other organizations simply see value in increasing the diversity of styles — “culture adds” — who can reduce the amount of sameness and groupthink — which in turn has benefits to innovation and complex problem-solving.

Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome.


## What I believe

**I believe** that teams are more important than superstars. Although it is always good to have around superstars so that we can learn from them.

**I believe** teams are gown not hired.

**I believe** (strongly!) on Conway's law: "any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose is a copy of the organisation communication structure". ${company_X} future partially depends on how well and often we communicate, let's optimise for it.

**I believe** that delivery velocity is largely determined by how well everyone understands where we are, where everyone is and where we're going (context). Chances are people will self-organise to move in the right direction and take ownership of their delivery. As a result, they will figure out ways to move faster.

**I believe** in Agile, Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery core principles. They are tools, don't make a great deal of the tools, make a great deal of what you build!

**I believe** that there's no such thing as personality conflicts at work. We may have disagreements, and that's OK, it's not personal. I'll always try to adjust to personalities styles and you should too.
